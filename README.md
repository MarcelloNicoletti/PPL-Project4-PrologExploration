# Principles of Programming Languages: Project 4: Prolog #

## Description ##

This project is to practice prolog by solving a polynomial sequence.

## Requirements ##

Create a predicate nextItem(L, N) that gives the next number in the
polynomial sequence given by the list L.
For example `nextItem([146, 394, 882, 1730, 3082], N)` should return
`N = 5106`.
